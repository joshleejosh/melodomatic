### TODO

* Build phrases instead of plucking random notes
  * Connectors between phrases: silence, leading notes, fills, gliss?
  * Repetition?
* Better MIDI
  * Program change?
  * Sysex?
* Ability to build standalone compositions w/o livecoding
  * Link and shift voices like scales
* !import paths should be relative to the script, not working dir (?)
