### TODO

* On reload, diff voices and maintain them if they haven't changed.
* Separate note hold (sustain) from duration (time til next note)
* noise: white; 1D perlin (as a replacement for $RW?)
* Build phrases instead of plucking random notes
  * Connectors between phrases: silence, leading notes, fills, gliss?
  * Repetition?
