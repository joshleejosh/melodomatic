### GENERATOR ##############################################
# Most parameter values are produced by GENERATOR functions
# that perform some logic to pick a value out of a list. The
# default generator picks randomly from the set, but you can
# override this behavior by specifying a different generator
# function with a '$' before the list of values.
#
# There are a number of generator functions to choose from:
#
# - $SCALAR        Returns a single value every time.
# - $LOOP          Iterates over its list in order.
# - $PINGPONG      Goes back and forth through its list.
# - $RANDOM        Picks a random value out of the list.
# - $SHUFFLE       Shuffles the list, goes through it, then
#                  reshuffles and goes through again.
# - $RANDOM-WALK   Walks up and down its list randomly based
#                  on a probability.
# - $WAVE          Generates a cycle of values on a curve,
#                  rather than picking from a list.
#
# A bare single number is wrapped in a $SCALAR generator.
# A bare list is wrapped in a $RANDOM generator.
#


# For voices, all parameters (EXCEPT for .channel and .seed)
# are generators.
:voice A

# The $LOOP function just goes through its values in order,
# then repeats.
.pitch $loop 1 2 3 4

# The $SCALAR function just returns a single value over and
# over again. In this example, the second value will be
# ignored.
.duration $scalar 2 1

# When a parameter only has a single value, the generator
# defaults to $SCALAR.
.velocity 64

:voice B

# The $RANDOM function picks randomly from the list every
# time it's called, as if you were rolling a dice to choose.
# This can result in long runs of repeated values.
.pitch $random 5 6 7 8

# The $SHUFFLE function works more like a deck of cards: the
# list is randomized, then gone through in order, and
# reshuffled when it's done to go through again. This will
# prevent long runs of repeated values.
.duration $shuffle 1 1 2 4 -1

# The $PINGONG function walks back and forth through the
# list. In this case, the voice will crescendo up the list,
# then decrescendo back down it.

# Even .transpose is a generator! You can use a function to
# transpose by different amounts each time. Weird, but you
# never know?
.transpose $random -12 -8 -5

# The $RANDOM-WALK function returns one of the values from
# the list repeatedly, until it randomly decides to shift
# one step up or down the list.
#
# When the generator changes values, it always does a coin
# flip to decide whether to go up or down the list, unless
# it's at the beginning or end, in which case it always
# moves inward.
.velocity $random-walk
 0.333             # The first argument to $RANDOM-WALK is
                   # NOT a velocity value – it's the
                   # probability that the function will
                   # change values on each call.
                   # Valid values are in the [0.0-1.0]
                   # range.
                   # In this example, we have a 33.3% chance
                   # to change velocities after each note.

# The $WAVE function generates a cyclical distribution of
# values on a curve. Unlike the other functions, this is a
# wholly generative function -- there is no list of values

                   # abbreviated to 'I', 'O', or 'IO').
       sine        # The EASING FUNCTION to use to generate
                   # the curve. This can be any of the
                   # common easing functions (see
                   # <http://easings.net/> for examples):

                   # of values it will output before
                   # starting over. This is the total
                   # period, so half of it will be spent
                   # rising, and half falling.
       48          # The MINIMUM VALUE returned. This is the
                   # value that will be returned at the
                   # beginning and end of the cycle.
       96          # The MAXIMUM VALUE returned. This is the
                   # value that will be returned at the
                   # halfway point of the cycle.
